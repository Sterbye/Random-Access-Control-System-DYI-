Simple DYI project for my friend. 
Random-Access-Control-System.

HW Setup used: Arduino UNO R3, RFID-RC522, I2C Display (16x2), 1x Green Light, 1x Red Light, Buzzer. 
Feel free to use and edit the code. 

Coded in Arduino IDE.
If you use VS Code or a different Text/IDE editor you have to download Arduino.h library (it's not in actual code because arduino IDE has built-in).

#IMPORTANT
You have to have installed libraries from Arduino official website https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/
Wire.h
LiquidCrystal_I2C.h
SPI.h
MFRC522.h
